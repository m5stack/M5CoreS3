## Description

`CoreS3` is the third generation of the M5Stack development kit series, its core master adopts the `ESP32-S3` solution, `dual-core Xtensa LX7` processor, the main frequency is`240MHz`, comes with '`WiFi`function, and the onboard `16MFLASH`and `8M-PSRAM`; It can `download the program`through the `TYPE-C` interface, support `OTG and CDC`functions, and facilitate external USB devices and flashing firmware; The front is equipped with a `2.0-inch capacitive touch IPS screen`, and the panel is made of `high-strength glass material`; A `30w pixel camera GC0308` is built into the bottom of the screen, with `proximity sensor LTR-553ALS-WA`; The power supply part adopts `AXP2101 power management core`chip and `4-way power flow control loop`, and the overall adopts `low power consumption` design; On-board `6-axis attitude sensor BMI270 and magnetometer BMM150`; On-board `TF-card (microSD)` card slot; On-board BM8563 `RTC` chip, providing accurate timing and `sleep-timer wake-up` function; In terms of sound output, it adopts high-fidelity `16bits-I2S` power amplifier chip AW88298, and the fuselage has a built-in `1w speaker`; In terms of sound input, ES7210 `audio decoding chip + dual microphone input` is adopted; On the side of the fuselage, there is a `independent power button and restart (RST) button`, self-built delay circuit, `long press the reset button to enter the program download mode`. The CoreS3 set comes with a `DinBase Base` by default, which is convenient for `Din rail, wall and screw fixing`; It can be powered by external `DC 12V (support 9~24V)` or internal `500mAh lithium battery`; DinBase reserves multiple `proto` locations for users to `DIY`. This finished product is suitable for scenarios such as `Internet of Things development, various DIY project development, smart home control system and industrial automation control system`.

**Power on and off operation:**<br>Power on: Click the left power button<br>shut down: Long press the left power button for 6 seconds <br>reset: Click the bottom RST button
